# Responsive Portfolio - Homework 2

A personal, responsive portfolio for Seth Zygarlicke.

# Purpose of Repository

This is the second Homework assignment for this bootcamp, consisting of three distinct .html pages that have responsive layouts depending on the screen size. The purpose of the homework exercise was to create pages using a Bootstrap grid system of rows, columns, and containers, that was also responsive to changes in screen size. Seth Zygarlicke was the sole creator and coder of this repository. The pages were to resemble the sample photos given in the repository. 

# Description

There are three pages associated with this repository. The first - Contact - consists of a container holding input forms for Name and Email, and an extra Message box. There is also a Submit button beneath these inputs, however this does not actually function. The second page, called About, consists of a container labeled 'About Me', with a picture of Seth and some descriptive text about him, wrapped around the image. It also contains some links to his relevant social media profiles. The third page, named Portfolio, also has a container holding a series of photos.

All of these pages have been formatted with the Bootstrap grid system to change layouts in response to different screen sizes. For example, the main containers in each of these pages will switch from taking up 75% of the page on large screens, to 67% of the page on medium screens, to 100% of the page (with neat margins, of course) on small screens. 

All of these pages have a Navbar that is also responsive. Namely, the Navbar will show the nav items in their entirety on large screens. However, for medium and small screens the nav items will collapse into a dropdown bar. Every page also contains a footer.

# Files in Repository

The main folder 02-Homework houses all three of the relevant html files - contact.html, index.html (the 'About Me' page), and portfolio.html. The style.css file Seth created to jazz up his sites also rests in the 02-Homework file. 

Inside 02-Homework sits another folder named Asset\Images. All of the sample photos upon which this project was based rest here, labeled after their respective sizes (400, 768, and 992) and pages. Within this folder sits another folder, named myImages. This folder holds all of the images Seth used when dressing up his pages, including the portfolio pictures, his About Me picture, and the backgroudn image.
