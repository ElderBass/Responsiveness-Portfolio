                            and the other 25% column being empty space. For md screens, I again had two columns, the one with the container being 67% of the page (col-md-9), 
                            while the empty column is 33%. For small screens, I had the column take up the entire width of the screen (col-sm-12)  -->

                        <p>Hello there! My name is Seth Zygarlicke and I am orginally from Grand Forks, ND, where I spent much of my formative years playing sports and vide games in equal measure.
                            I graduated from the University of North Dakota in 2013 with a BS in Mathematics before entering UND's School of Medicine and Health Sciences in 2014. I completed over two years
                            of this program before I was dismissed for reasons of conduct (looonng story). I moved to Fargo, ND during this period, working in the service industry as a server and bartender
                            before I made the move to Minneapolis, MN in 2018. I have been living and working here, wondering what to do myself, until I heard of this boot camp and pulled the trigger!
                            <br> <br> <br> <!--Empty space to break up blocks of text.-->
                            I LOVE being active. Running, biking, hiking, yoga, basketball, football, tennis...literally anything involving athletics and/or physical activity is my jam. Additionally, I love reading books
                            of almost all variety, including sci-si/fantasy, classic literature, academic nonfiction, and graphic novels. Another principle hobby of mine is playing video games. Currently I am grossly obsessed with Destiny 2, but I love most types of games. 
                            I also thoroughly enjoy select podcasts, usually of the heady, discussion-filled type (e.g. Sam Harris's 'Making Sense'). I am deeply interested in the universe's greatest mysteries, mainly the brain/consciousness, and quantum physics. 
                            My current goals include learning to code (ayyyy), teaching myself piano, and developing fluency in Spanish.
